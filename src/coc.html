      <h1 class="c-heading c-heading--large">Code of Conduct</h1>
      <p class="c-paragraph--medium">We are committed to creating a <mark>safe environment for everybody</mark>. We take diversity and inclusion very seriously, promote a humble way of approaching others and do not tolerate harassment in any form. To create a baseline of understanding what this means, this code of conduct is published. This code of conduct applies to everybody at the event: attendees, supporters, sponsors, staff and volunteers. By attending or otherwise taking part you are agreeing to honour this code of conduct.</p>
      <p class="c-paragraph--medium">Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
      <p class="c-paragraph--medium">Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including expulsion from the conference without a refund.</p>
      <p class="c-paragraph--medium">When you feel you are being harassed or think that your or anyone else's safety, either physical or emotional, is being threatened, please let us know. It will be dealt with swiftly by taking your security and privacy very seriously. No follow up action will be taken without your approval. When witnessing acts identifiable as against Dutch law please contact law enforcement via telephone number 112.</p>

      <p class="c-paragraph--medium">
        Our Refresh conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference <strong>without a refund</strong> at the discretion of the conference organisers.

      <h2 class="c-heading c-heading--medium">The Less Quick Version</h2>
      <p class="c-paragraph--medium">
        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
      </p>
      <p class="c-paragraph--medium">
        Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="c-paragraph--medium">
        Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
      </p>
      <p class="c-paragraph--medium">
        If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
      </p>
      <p class="c-paragraph--medium">
        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.
      </p>
      <p class="c-paragraph--medium">
        Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
      </p>
      <p class="c-paragraph--medium">
        We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.
      </p>
