      <h1 class="c-heading c-heading--large">Code of Conduct</h1>
      <p class="c-paragraph--medium">We are committed to creating a safe environment for everybody. We take diversity and inclusion very seriously, promote a humble way of approaching others and do not tolerate harassment in any form. To create a baseline of understanding what this means, this code of conduct is published. This code of conduct applies to everybody at the event: attendees, supporters, sponsors, staff and volunteers. By attending or otherwise taking part you are agreeing to honour this code of conduct.</p>
      <p class="c-paragraph--medium">Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
      <p class="c-paragraph--medium">Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including expulsion from the conference without a refund.</p>
      <p class="c-paragraph--medium">When you feel you are being harassed or think that your or anyone else's safety, either physical or emotional, is being threatened, please let us know. It will be dealt with swiftly by taking your security and privacy very seriously. No follow up action will be taken without your approval. When witnessing acts identifiable as against Dutch law please contact law enforcement via telephone number 112.</p>
